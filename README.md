<h3>Challenges</h3>
This was by far the most frustrating project I've done. My biggest challenge was getting the navbar to move from the left side to the top. At first I thought it was a syntax or media query issue. I spent several days headbanging, reverse engineering, and getting hints from other devs. Eventually after pair programming with one dev I realized I had gotten tangled in a CSS rabbit hole. My rules were cancelling each other out and rendering in order of specificity. Long story short, I had to delete some unnecessary code.

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
Sometimes working harder is counterintuitive. Taking a break sucks. Not seeing immediate progress sucks. But taking a step back to explicitly define the problem, down to the individual changes you'd like to see, will help you find the underlying issue. When in doubt pair program.
