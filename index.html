          <h1>Using media queries</h1>
          <p>
            Media queries allow you to apply CSS styles depending on a device's
            general type (such as print vs. screen) or other characteristics
            such as screen resolution or browser viewport width. Media queries
            are used for the following:
          </p>
          <ul id="spaced-list">
            <li>
              To conditionally apply styles with the CSS @media and @import
              at-rules.
            </li>
            <li>
              To target specific media for the style, link, source, and other
              HTML elements with the media= attribute.
            </li>
            <li>
              To test and monitor media states using the Window.matchMedia() and
              MediaQueryList.addListener() JavaScript methods.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="header2">
          <h1>Syntax</h1>
          <p>
            A media query is composed of an optional media type and any number
            of media feature expressions, which may optionally be combined in
            various ways using logical operators. Media queries are
            case-insensitive.
          </p>
          <ul id="spaced-list">
            <li>
              Media types define the broad category of device for which the
              media query applies: all, print, screen. The type is optional
              (assumed to be all) except when using the not or only logical
              operators.
            </li>
            <li>
              Media features describe a specific characteristic of the user
              agent, output device, or environment
            </li>
            <li>
              For example, the hover feature allows a query to test against
              whether the device supports hovering over elements. Media feature
              expressions test for their presence or value, and are entirely
              optional. Each media feature expression must be surrounded by
              parentheses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Logical operators can be used to compose a complex media query:
              not, and, and only. You can also combine multiple media queries
              into a single rule by separating them with commas.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            A media query computes to true when the media type (if specified)
            matches the device on which a document is being displayed and all
            media feature expressions compute as true. Queries involving unknown
            media types are always false.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="header3">
          <h1>Targeting media types</h1>
          <p>
            Media types describe the general category of a given device.
            Although websites are commonly designed with screens in mind, you
            may want to create styles that target special devices such as
            printers or audio-based screen readers. For example, this CSS
            targets printers:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media print { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            You can also target multiple devices. For instance, this @media rule
            uses two media queries to target both screen and print devices:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media screen, print { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            See media type for a list of all media types. Because they describe
            devices in only very broad terms, just a few are available; to
            target more specific attributes, use media features instead.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="header4">
          <h1>Targeting media features</h1>
          <p>
            Media features describe the specific characteristics of a given user
            agent, output device, or environment. For instance, you can apply
            specific styles to widescreen monitors, computers that use mice, or
            to devices that are being used in low-light conditions. This example
            applies styles when the user's primary input mechanism (such as a
            mouse) can hover over elements:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media (hover: hover) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Many media features are range features, which means they can be
            prefixed with "min-" or "max-" to express "minimum condition" or
            "maximum condition" constraints. For example, this CSS will apply
            styles only if your browser's viewport width is equal to or narrower
            than 1250px:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media (max-width: 1250px) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            If you create a media feature query without specifying a value, the
            nested styles will be used as long as the feature's value is not
            zero (or none, in Level 4). For example, this CSS will apply to any
            device with a color screen:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box"><code>@media (color) { /* … */ } </code></div>
          <p>
            If a feature doesn't apply to the device on which the browser is
            running, expressions involving that media feature are always false.
            For more Media feature examples, please see the reference page for
            each specific feature.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="header5">
          <h1>Creating complex media queries</h1>
          <p>
            Sometimes you may want to create a media query that depends on
            multiple conditions. This is where the logical operators come in:
            not, and, and only. Furthermore, you can combine multiple media
            queries into a comma-separated list; this allows you to apply the
            same styles in different situations.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the previous example, we've already seen the and operator used to
            group a media type with a media feature. The and operator can also
            combine multiple media features into a single media query. The not
            operator, meanwhile, negates a media query, basically reversing its
            normal meaning. The only operator prevents older browsers from
            applying the styles.
          </p>
          <h2>Combining multiple types of features</h2>
          <p>
            The and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other
            media features. This example combines two media features to restrict
            styles to landscape-oriented devices with a width of at least 30
            ems:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code
              >@media (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape) { /* … */ }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            To limit the styles to devices with a screen, you can chain the
            media features to the screen media type:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code
              >@media screen and (min-width: 30em) and (orientation: landscape)
              { /* … */ }
            </code>
          </div>
          <h2>Testing for multiple queries</h2>
          <p>
            You can use a comma-separated list to apply styles when the user's
            device matches any one of various media types, features, or states.
            For instance, the following rule will apply its styles if the user's
            device has either a minimum height of 680px or is a screen device in
            portrait mode:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code
              >@media (min-height: 680px), screen and (orientation: portrait) {
              /* … */ }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Taking the above example, if the user had a printer with a page
            height of 800px, the media statement would return true because the
            first query would apply. Likewise, if the user were on a smartphone
            in portrait mode with a viewport height of 480px, the second query
            would apply and the media statement would still return true.
          </p>
          <h2>Inverting a query's meaning</h2>
          <p>
            The not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query. It
            will only negate the specific media query it is applied to. (Thus,
            it will not apply to every media query in a comma-separated list of
            media queries.) The not keyword can't be used to negate an
            individual feature query, only an entire media query. The not is
            evaluated last in the following query:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media not all and (monochrome) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>This means that the above query is evaluated like this:</p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media not (all and (monochrome)) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <h2>Improving compatability with older browsers</h2>
          <p>
            The only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media
            queries with media features from applying the given styles. It has
            no effect on modern browsers.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="header6">
          <h1>Syntax improvements in Level 4</h1>
          <p>
            The Media Queries Level 4 specification includes some syntax
            improvements to make media queries using features that have a
            "range" type, for example width or height, less verbose. Level 4
            adds a range context for writing such queries. For example, using
            the max- functionality for width we might write the following:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media (max-width: 30em) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>In Media Queries Level 4 this can be written as:</p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media (max-width: 30em) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Using min- and max- we might test for a width between two values
            like so:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code
              >@media (min-width: 30em) and (max-width: 50em) { /* … */ }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>This would convert to the Level 4 syntax as:</p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media (30em <= width <= 50em) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Media Queries Level 4 also adds ways to combine media queries using
            full boolean algebra with and, not, and or.
          </p>
          <h2>Negating a feature with not</h2>
          <p>
            Using not() around a media feature negates that feature in the
            query. For example, not(hover) would match if the device had no
            hover capability:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media (not(hover)) { /* … */ } </code>
          </div>
          <h2>Testing for multiple features or</h2>
          <p>
            You can use or to test for a match among more than one feature,
            resolving to true if any of the features are true. For example, the
            following query tests for devices that have a monochrome display or
            hover capability:
          </p>
          <div class="code-box">
            <code>@media (not (color)) or (hover) { /* … */ } </code>
